{"name":"Simple-resume","tagline":"Simple, responsively designed, single page resume website","body":"Simple Resume is meant to be used as an online vcard. Its purpose is to make it possible for anyone to have a solid online resume without having to be skilled in web design.\r\n\r\n## The idea\r\nThe idea was to create a readable, minimalistic, profesionally looking, responsive and feather-light single page online resume. Consider this an extension to your printed business card. Also an alternative to PDF resumes. There is a \"Print this resume\" button at the bottom, should someone insist of having it on paper or in a form of a PDF file.\r\n\r\n## Truly responsive\r\nNo site can truly be considered responsive if it's not quick to load, even on very slow mobile data connections (like 2G). Hence the use of icon fonts, SVG backgrounds and vanilla JS. Furthermore, the only real image on the site is your bio picture. Aside from its own weight (which is completely up to your personal preferences), the rest of the assets should not exceed 20 kB in size. Also, the site will make only 9 network requests, and that's counting the Google Analytics stuff.\r\n\r\n## Plans for the future\r\n* To make Simple Resume extremely easy to use for everyone - create a build tool.\r\n* Expand current choice of social network/media links.\r\n* Improve \"Print\" function by printing URLs of all links in the document in form of footnotes.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
